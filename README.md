**🔍 Project Overview**
---
We give a local geometric characterization of semantic invariance in language models: paraphrases tend to move along nuisance directions, while meaning lives in a more stable subspace. Contrasting meaning-preserving and meaning-changing edits recovers that subspace. Interventions test it, and its model-specific geometry supports zero-shot model attribution.

**🧪 Synthetic Data Set**
---
To isolate meaning-preserving (SP) vs meaning-changing (SC) variation, we construct a synthetic English dataset of short prompts organized into semantic groups. Each group starts from an anchor sentence; SP variants paraphrase the anchor, soft SC variants keep the same topic family but change the intended meaning, and hard SC variants move to a different topic or domain. Groups span multiple domains, with disjoint discovery and validation splits (1,400 groups · 13 domains · 57,400 sentences overall). The table below shows one sample of each type for ten example groups (counts per group in the column headers).

| Group | SP (20) | Soft SC (10) | Hard SC (10) |

**📊 Results Snapshot**
---
Invariant-zone signatures identify the source model under base, fine-tuned, and distilled variants. The plot below shows Group 1 attribution accuracy (%) from the project page (Figure 7), with strong performance across model families.
